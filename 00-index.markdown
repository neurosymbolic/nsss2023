Please join us for the 3rd Neuro-Symbolic Summer School (NSSS), to be held Sep 4-6, 2024. 

NSSS '24 is the latest in a series of events that alternate between research workshops and summer schools that aim to accelerate progress in the fast-emerging area of neuro-symbolic AI by teaching graduate students, data scientists, and researchers principles from the side of AI they may be less familiar with, as well as presenting emerging research ideas at the intersection.

 Confirmed speakers this year will include:
- Paul Smolensky, Microsoft Research
- Alvaro Velasquez, DARPA
- Alessandra Russo, Imperial College London
- The next generation of AI startups, focusing on neuro-symbolic AI
with more to be announced.

Our last Neuro-Symbolic Summer School event (2023), attracted 3500+ registrants and featured top researchers including two Turing Award winners, Les Valiant and Yoshua Bengio.
 
The focus of the event is on techniques, in particular those which augment neural network/ML ideas with symbolic AI ideas, to address at least three main open problems of AI:  1) human interpretability/controllability, 2) learning with less data/computation (e.g. via knowledge), and 3) out-of-distribution generalization (e.g. via reasoning).

- [Winter 2022:  1500+ registrations (1st research event)](http://ibm.biz/ns-wkshp)

While initially organized by IBM Research, these activities are now general research community events under the auspices of the new non-profit Centaur AI Institute, organized in collaboration with leaders of the NeSy annual meeting, owing to the explosion of interest in this emerging topic we have observed.
